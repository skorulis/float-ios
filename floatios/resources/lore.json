No one can say why land shouldn't float, it's just a feeling that everyone has. Everyone arrived the same way, waking up outside remembering nothing except their name. "

In the early days some people created boats to sail between the islands, this fairly quickly became a last resort for travelling after boats were swallowed by the enourmous fish that live in the depths."
